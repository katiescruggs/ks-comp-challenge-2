# ks-comp-challenge-2

For this static comp challenge, I was inspired by the collection of fairy tales written by the Brothers Grimm. I decided to create the site in German to call to mind the original (more interesting and more gruesome) versions of the classic fairy tales rather than the Disney versions. This layout was achieved with CSS Flexbox and made responsive with media queries.
